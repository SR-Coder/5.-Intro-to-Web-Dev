# Welcome to Introduction to Web Development

## Ice Breaker
- Welcome lets start with an ice breaker
    - depending on how many are in attendance
        - in chat 
        - on voice
    - Who you are, where you are from, and one of the following
        - If you could make one animal the size of a horse, which would you choose and why?
        - What's your favorite TV show?
        - Why do you want to learn to code?

## Skills assessment
- Ok.. lets take a poll and see what level the class is at.  
    - these polls are built in so just activate it at the bottom of the page.
- results of the poll will determine where we go from here.

## What is a web app vs what is software
- quickly describe what we teach and the differences and similarities between software development and web development.  Make sure prospective students understand that while we teach Web App development, the skills they learn here help them to learn how to learn!!  Thus after the boot camp they can go on to do anything.

## The Request Response Cycle
- In very broad terms discuss the request response cycle.
- its a good idea to just draw this on the screen or have a google page set up with illustrations so that people can have something to look at.  Make sure to not dwell on it, we are not looking to get into the weeds on this just give the basics.  
    - consider google, how is the page delivered to you?
        - browser sends a GET request, server responds with...
            - HTML, CSS, JS
    - You search for say... Cute cat videos
        - browser sends a POST request
        - Server looks to see if it has a search route
        - server checks the database for cute cat videos
        - server sends said cute cat videos back. and viola!!!
